# Project 1 - Random Cat Fact Generator

## Project Description:

A simple, interactive web application that displays a random cat fact and a random cat image, using two public APIs and styled with Tailwind CSS.

This project was created for the Codecademy Fullstack Bootcamp Group Project 1. It is designed to demonstrate understanding of basic HTML structure, the use of API's and a new (to us) CSS Framework.

## How to Run

1. Download or clone the repository
2. Open **index.html** in your browser
3. Click the button to load a new fact + image

## How It Works

- `fetch()` gets a random fact from **catfact.ninja/fact**
- Another `fetch()` gets cat images from Pixabay
- A random image from the results is displayed
- Tailwind handles styling and layout

## Project Team:
- Cesar
- Chrissy
- Rick
- Marina

The vast majority of the codebase was done as peer programming with the whole group. Cesar individually contributed to Tailwind Styling. README was created by Chrissy. Default cat photo is compliments of Marina.

## Future Improvements

- Cat paw cursor
- Meow sound on button press
- Better image cropping
- Adding a daily cat fact for a specific calender date
